## Format Note

This spec uses `snake_case` keys, which is what the Flat File version of the Recipe expects. The **Universal API Faculty Leave Balances Widget Recipe** uses `camelCase` keys instead.

If referencing for the Universal API version, see its Recipe documentation for its specific format, as it is not the same as the Flat File version.
