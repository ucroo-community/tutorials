# Academic Profile Widget file format

Details populated in the Academic Profile widget can be requested from:
- the /users endpoint in Pathify API
- a Flow cache
- an external source (API)

If a customer wants to send a separate file from the user provisioning process, this is the required format. It is not required for a customer to send this file in order to have the academic profile widget.
